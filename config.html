<h1>Solar Fan Controller - SOLFACON</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Configuration tool &amp; build instructions</h3>

Please read through the whole page before you start assembling the controller. If you for instance plan on mounting the controller in an enclosure, there are some considerations to be taken before choosing your components and assembling the PCB. Selecting or deselecting features will also update the instructions accordingly.

<p>Recommended fan: Arctic P12.<br>
Alternatively another fan optimized for static air pressure. There are fans that can move larger volumes of air, but since ventilation usually involves pushing air through a pipe, perhaps with a grille, filter or insect net attached, air pressure is perhaps the most important parameter.</p>
<p>Recommended solar panel: 20-30W, open circuit voltage of 20-23V.<br>
If you only need one fan and live in a sunny region, you could perhaps make do with 10W. Some sellers advertise small solar panels with open circuit voltages of 20-23V as being 12V panels. Sometimes this is because the panel has a 12V voltage regulator built-in (attached to the back side), but often it is just misleading marketing. Do not get a solar panel with a 12V regulator built-in and read the product details to find the open circuit voltage. Be wary of sellers inflating panel wattage.</p>

<h2>Programming instructions</h2>
The .ino file containing the fan controller source code for the ATtiny85 MCU was made using the Arduino IDE. You can compile and upload it to the MCU using an Arduino as ISP, a USBtinyISP, or any other ISP you prefer. The software is not intended to be used in combination with a boot loader. You can set the MCU fuses to the following values:<br>
Low = 0xE2<br>
High = 0xDD<br>
Extended = 0xFF<br>
<br>
The important detail here is that the code is designed to run at 8 MHz, or else timer0 which controls PWM will be off. It is recommended to enable BOD (brow out detection), since the MCU is expected to brown out circa once a day when running on solar power. How to "burn" the fuses depends on which ATtiny library you are using in the Arduino IDE.

<h2>Assembly instructions</h2>
<h3>Enclosure (only applicable for F19 and F19-1 enclosures)</h3>
<p>For all holes, use drill bits for metal and do not use drill bits meant for wood or masonry. Securely fasten the enclosure parts that you intend to drill in before commencing. Drill at somewhat high RPM but proceed only slowly through the material - remove only very little material at the time and do not let the material heat up. Wet drilling can be preferable if your enclosure is made of polycarbonate, as mechanical stress and heat can make it shatter.</p>

<p>Drill one or two holes for the cables to the fan<span class="showif-cfg_two-fans">s</span> and the solar panel.<br>
Option A: A hole can be drilled in the enclosure wall directly across from where the U-shaped indent in the PCB will be located once the PCB is seated. After seating the PCB, you can secure the cables using a cable tie screwed into the enclosure mounting hole at the indent.<br>
Option B: You can also drill 8mm or 10mm holes left of "POWER" (rotate the screw terminal 180 degrees when assembling the PCB!) and right of "FAN1" (place the fan header at FAN2 when assembling the PCB!), and glue on M8 or M10 nylon cable glands for power and fan cables.</p>
<p class="showif-cfg_on-off">
Place the unassembled PCB backside up in the enclosure lid, and make a mark through the whole labelled "5mm". Drill a 5mm hole here and mount the on/off toggle switch here when you are done drilling all the enclosure holes. The on/off positions of the switch can be any which way you prefer (up, down, left right). Attach a wire to the centre pin and another wire to one of the two other pins of the switch. Attach the other ends of the wires to pin header S1-A (short end).

<p class="showif-cfg_max-speed">
Place the unassembled PCB backside up in the enclosure lid, and make a mark through the wholes labelled "7mm" and "3mm". Drill holes of the specified diameter here and mount the rotary potentiometer when you are done drilling all the enclosure holes. Attach a wire to each of the potentiometer's three solder lugs, and attach the other ends of the wires to pin header RV1-A (short end). The wires should be attached to both the potentiometer and the pin header in the same order - do not move or "twist" them.

<h3>PCB</h3>
<center><img src="pcb_examples.jpg" style="width:800px"><p class="note">PCBs for two different configurations</p></center><br>
Assembly of the PCB is straight forward, just solder the components onto the PCB at the designated locations. The silk screen print should face upwards when done. Mind component orientation, vertical/horizontal components, and seat components as close to the PCB surface as possible to ensure enclosure lid clearance.
<div>Based on your configuration, do note the following:
<ul>
    <li class="hideif-cfg_protection-diode">Bridge D1 using a staple jumper wire or similar.</li>
    <li class="hideif-cfg_on-off">Bridge S1 using a staple jumper wire or similar.</li>
    <li class="showif-cfg_low-power">Ignore C-ALT - do not place components at this location.</li>
    <li class="hideif-cfg_low-power">Ignore C7, C8, D4, R2, R3, Q2 - do not place components at these locations.</li>
    <li class="hideif-cfg_max-speed">Ignore C11, R4, R5, RV1, Q3 - do not place components at these locations.</li>
    <li class="hideif-cfg_two-fans">The fan header can be placed at either FAN1 or FAN2.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Final touches</h3>
<center><img src="enclosure_example2.jpg" style="width:400px"><p class="note">Enclosure with transparent lid</p></center><br>
<p>Screw the assembled PCB into the enclosure and mount the enclosure on the wall (optional).</p>
<p>Female MOLEX fan connectors can easily be taken apart (non destructively) such that they are easier to get though holes. On the back side of the female fan connector, there are little slots in the plastic through which metal clips can be seen. Using a needle or another pointy object, gently push down on the tiny clip and pull one wire out at the time. Run the wires through the hole in the enclosure and re-attach the plastic part of the connector. Be sure to attach the wires in the same position as they were.</p>
<p>Connect the wires from the solar panel to the POWER screw terminal, but do not expose the solar panel to light. <span class="showif-cfg_max-speed">Connect the potentiometer by connecting RV1 to RV1-A.</span> <span class="showif-cfg_on-off">Connect the on/off switch by connecting S1 to S1-A.</span> Make sure that everything is connected correctly, and carefully place the lid on the enclosure. Let light hit the solar panel and the fan<span class="showif-cfg_two-fans">s</span> should spin up in a few seconds.</p>

        I honestly have no idea what to make of this monstrosity for finding an intersection between two equations. My maths teacher surely wouldn't have liked it, but it wasn't until after I was done that I remembered about calculus. It is easy to change the base equations without having to remodel the whole procedure in this way though, and it seems to give decent results which is all we want?
